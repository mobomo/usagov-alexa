Steps you had issues with?
- I didn't have any problems with the steps in the Pet Match tutorial
- I didn't have any problems with the steps in the ACDL Conversion Tutorial until I actually tried to test the skill in the "Alexa Simulator" of the "Test" tab in the Pet Match CLI developer console.
- I was using the alexa simulator in the test tab, not an actual device. I only used text input for testing the "Pet Match CLI" skill
